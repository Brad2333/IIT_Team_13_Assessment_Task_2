One of the jobs differentiates a bit compared to the others and that is the role of IT Support Engineer, the job of IT Support Engineer mainly entitles evaluating and diagnosing technical problems and issues but in saying that still crosses paths with the other jobs. All the jobs, even though being different to each other, require some similar training whether it being coding or web development they all cross paths one way or another.  </p>
