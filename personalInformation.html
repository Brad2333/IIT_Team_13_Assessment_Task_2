                <h3>James Costello</h3>
                <p>Originally from the UK, I came out to live in Australia permanently in 2003.I have a Diploma in Software Development and an Advanced Diploma in Business Analysis through TAFE NSW. I love participating in sport and running is my passion, but you’ll also catch me out bushwalking or cycling. I recently have developed a love for motorbikes and I'm planning many road trips to come. I love Rock and Metal music, but you’ll find me buying tickets to a symphony. I have a Jack Russell cross named Banjo who loves to run with me once or twice a week. I am married (17 years and the reason I’m in Australia) and we have a daughter. </p>

                <h3>Geoffrey Davis</h3>
                <p>My name is Geoffrey Davis, I am 27 years of age and currently live in far north QLD Australia. I am an Australian citizen and unfortunately only speak English, I have though been lucky enough to have lived overseas for several years. I graduated high school in 2011 and then went on the starting a 4-year apprenticeship as a heavy diesel fitter, after completing my apprenticeship I had the opportunity to go work on a copper mine in Zambia (Africa) where I was based for 2 years working for the construction team finalizing the mine as it was in the process of getting build. </p>
                <p>After my stint in Africa, I returned to Australia where I have been working in several industries such as hospitality and mechanic. My passion is WW2 aircraft, I love the background and history of the aircraft as well as the mechanics behind them, the mechanics behind dogfighting intrigue me and the skill that was required to fly back in the 1940s, I build model planes when I get time as well as fly on WW2 flight simulators. </p>
                <p>My interest in IT started when I was a young boy, I have been a gamer since I can remember, I think because of that my interest in IT just grew from there. When I got my first computer, I started doing things like downloading games and movies through torrents as back then my internet was not so great so I could only really play single player games, after a bit I started to mod games and would run into Erros with files and system errors, being determined I use to scour the web trying to find the solution to the problem whether it be changing the games settings in notepad or changing IPs etc., all so I could solve the problem. While doing so I found myself really enjoying the fault-finding process and the satisfaction achieved when I finally fixed the issue. </p>

                <h3>Matthew Manriquez</h3>
                <p>Hello, my name is Matt, and I'm 27 years old. I graduated from high school in the 12th grade. I'm now studying introduction to information technology and introduction to programming at RMIT. Some of my favourite pastimes are taking my pet dog Lola for a walk, watching sports, gaming, reading, and spending time with loved ones. I come from a Spanish family and can communicate in the language. </p>

                <h3>Jesse Watson</h3>
                <p>My name is Jesse Watson. I’m 17 years old and love technology. I’m one of those annoying Apple fans, but strangely working backwards with the products I buy - first an iPad, then a Mac and hopefully soon that slick iPhone 13 Mini. I value fitness; running and mountain biking being my favourite fitness activities. I also value my relationship with my family, friends and God. </p>
                <p>In a team environment, I can struggle with putting myself out there, but I push through those barriers and have great experiences because of it. I also am quite a perfectionist and pride myself on being organised and on time. </p>
                <p>I enjoy being creative, usually through the lens of a camera and the timeline in a video editing software (Final Cut Pro X). I have a YouTube channel where I share with the world these creations. And I’m now developing my creative muscle in programming. </p>
