    <h1>Team Profile</h1>
    
    <p>Above is a graph of all 6 team members' personality tests. While looking at all the data in a summarized view we can start to understand the team’s capabilities and where each team member’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    
    <h3>James Costello</h3>
    
    <p>James shows strong leadership skills, this proves especially useful to our team as he provides the backbone for the team and gives the team stability. As well as his leadership skills he shows ability in being able to take a step back and ensure things are being done correctly and efficiently. </p>
    
    <h3>Bradley Williams</h3>
    
    <p>Bradley's results show that he could provide the team with great ideas and planning and although being of a quiet nature can be brought out of his shell when feeling welcomed and valued to the team, which our team does well. </p>
    
    <h3>Matthew Manriquez</h3>
    
    <p>Mathews results show that he is a hard worker and strives to ensure the team achieves their goals, by doing so leaving his footprint on the team’s efforts. Mathews results show us that he is not as great of an idea person but where he lacks the other team members make up for. </p>
    
    <h3>Hayden Bleys</h3>
    
    <p>Hayden brings strong attributes to our team, those being his ability to plan and structure tasks as well as analyze the completed work to ensure perfection as he does not like doing tasks for a second time. Hayden’s test also shows that he likes to get straight to the point which is another useful trait to have in a team but sometimes taking the time can be a useful tool to the building and structure of a task. </p>
    
    <h3>Geoffrey Davis</h3>
    
    <p>Geoffrey shows strength in practicality, showing strong attributes in prioritizing and scheduling tasks. The ability to schedule and prioritize tasks is key to the successful completion of tasks and assignments. Geoffrey’s results also show his ability to connect well with others, allowing the building of a formidable team. </p>
    
    <h3>Jesse Watson</h3>
    
    <p>Jesse is a very cool and collective person, which provides a great attribute to the team as in all team environments there will always be confrontation and having a team member there to calm the situation and find an alternatim that pleases everyone is invaluable. Jesse’s results also show that he likes to experiment with different methods before committing to a certain path which is great for brainstorming. </p>
    
    <h3>Team Overall Summary</h3>
    
    <p>By reviewing all our personal tests, we can see where other members in our team lack and where others are strong. This allows the team to delegate appropriately allowing the team members to work in areas where they are strong and excel in. It also allows the team to build structure by appointing team leaders who will take charge and delegate as well as giving everyone a place in the team where they are comfortable. All these things lead to a great team and allow for the completion of the assignment to the highest standard. </p>
